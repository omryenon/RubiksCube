# Rubik's Cube is fun!
 The program simulates2x2x2 Rubik's Cube and solve it using 2 different algorithms: Iterative Backtrack and GraphSearch using Algorithm A*.

 -The Heuristic I usedmis represented in the Documentation attached in the repository page. You are welcome to test it and improve the efficiency using your Heuristic. There are always better Heuristics for different cases.

 Just run the program "Rubik_2x2x2.py" as is, will set a default state for the Cube and solve it. 
 For trying your input: "Rubik_2x2x2.py <your input>"
for example: python3 Rubiks_Cube.py GRGRYYYYOGOGBOBOWWWWBRBR
