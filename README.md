# Rubik's Cube is fun!
 The program simulates 2x2x2 Rubik's Cube and solve it using 2 different algorithms: Iterative Backtrack and GraphSearch using Algorithm A*.

 -The Heuristic I used is represented in the Documentation attached in the repository page. You are welcome to test it and improve the efficiency using your Heuristic. There are always better Heuristics for different cases.

 Just run the program "Rubik_2x2x2.py" as is, will set a default state for the Cube and solve it. 
 For trying your input: Rubik_2x2x2.py YOUR_INPUT
for example: python3 Rubiks_Cube.py GRGRYYYYOGOGBOBOWWWWBRBR

# Rubik's Cube representation

The Rubik's Cube representation is shown in the code under "sticker indices".
The following website helped me understand how to represent the Cube's states in this project:
